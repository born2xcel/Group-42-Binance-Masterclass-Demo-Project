Group 42 Final Project for Binance 8 Weeks Africa Masterclass

### Farming and Staking Project

<<<<<<< HEAD
The project is aimed primarily at solid waste minimization and control using a token as an incentive mechanism. A greater part of Africa today is faced with the challenge of poor solid waste management. On the other hand, the benefit of an efficient, sustainable and scalable approach cannot be overemphasized. A clean and habitable environment is key to our collective co-existence, hence the need for the project.
The target groups for this project are the regulated community, waste collectors, and recyclers. In mid 1980's and early 1990's, a system of trade by barter was being used by waste collectors to incentivize waste generators. For example, two plastic plates could exchange for 10 empty coca cola bottles. Today, waste collectors and scavenger still go around searching for valuables sometimes setting electrical and electronic waste materials ablaze in an unsustainable environmental manner to recover precious metals like lead, silver, gold, mercury amongst others from used electrical and electronic waste. The recovered items are then sold to waste recyclers for little money. This entire process, using Blockchain technology, can be automated and managed in an efficient manner that will benefit all parties involved as well as the environment.

#### Method
The idea will be implemented in phases, but for this particular project, concentration is majorly centered on the token (SWT) implementation.
The project consists of 3 solidity contracts serving the backend and which are;
1. CoinfproToken contract which serves as the exchange for SWT token distribution. It consists of two events i.e. Transfer and Approval. Also, it has four functions such as transfer, _transfer, approve and transferFrom. Other features of this contract is as noted below;
    - Token name: coinfpro
    - Token symbol: CFP
    - Total supply: 1,000,000 CFP
2. SolidWasteToken contract which essentially is the token that will be used to incentivize waste generators and collectors. This consists of two events like the first contract namely; Transfer and Approval. It also contains four functions i.e. transfer, _transfer, approve and transfer from. Other features of this contract is as mentioned below;
    - Token name: SolidWasteToken
    - Token symbol: SWT
    - Total supply: 1,000,000 SWT

TokenFarm is the last of the three contracts wherein the earlier two contracts were imported. It incorporates mapping to handle the staking features. There are four functions which are stakeToken, unstakeToken, stakeAmount and issueToken, all of which are public. This enables participants to stake CFP token to get SWT in a farming and staking process.

The target groups for this project are the regulated community, waste collectors, and recyclers. In mid 1980's and early 1990's a system of trade

Today, waste collectors and scavengers still go around searching for valuables sometimes setting electrical and electronic waste materials ablaze in an 
unsustainable environmental manner to recover precious metals like lead, silver, gold, mecury amongst others from used electrical and electronic waste. 
The recovered items are then sold to waste recyclers for little money. This entire process can be automated and managed in a way that will benefit all parties 
invloved and the environment as well. 

The idea will be implemented in phases, but for this particular project, we will concentrate majorly on the token implementation using solidity as well as the 
distribution/Airdrop of the Solid Waste Control Token (SWT) using the staking and Farming contract. We will also design a simple and friendly user interface
using HTML, CSS and javascript to allow users to interact with the staking and farming contract.

The front end is implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript to achieve a simple but user-friendly UI to enable web interaction of the farming and staking process.
